     * Solution to optional exercise A1:
     * This solution is a bit more efficient and uses the property that if we reach a value which is a power of 2, then
     * we know that the all the remaining numbers will be divided by two. The amount of how often we have to do that is
     * the log2(n).
     * E.g. n=16 sqrt(16)=4  16,8,4,2,1
     * With some patience, this version can already come up with a solution for n=10,000,000,000 but it still takes time.
     * We can make this even faster by using a sort of dynamical approach. 
     * If you don't understand the code, try to debug it before contacting me
