/**
 * Solution to optional exercise A1:
 * Note that this solution is not very efficient and but it should be your first attempt. Refer to A2_fast for a more
 * efficient solution.
 * It is best to try the problem yourself first and refer to the solution if you are stuck!
 * The excessive use of comments is to provide a more explicit explanation of the code as some concepts which are not yet
 * covered are used.
 * If you don't understand the code, try to debug it before contacting me
